# Analysis Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used in the New Jersey Consolidation Analysis project, including data sources, analytical approaches, and key assumptions.

## Data Sources

### Primary Data
- **US Census Bureau**: Population data, demographic information
- **New Jersey Department of State**: Municipal boundaries, government structure
- **OpenStreetMap**: Geographic data and boundaries

### Sample Data
For demonstration purposes, the project includes sample data based on:
- 2020 US Census population figures
- Known municipal boundaries and areas
- Estimated demographic distributions

## Analytical Framework

### 1. Population Analysis
- **Current State**: Analysis of existing municipal population distribution
- **Consolidation Scenarios**: Multiple consolidation options (5-county, 3-county, single county)
- **Comparative Analysis**: Ranking against other US and world cities

### 2. Economic Impact Assessment
- **Government Efficiency**: Estimated savings from reduced administrative overhead
- **Infrastructure Benefits**: Improved coordination and efficiency
- **Service Delivery**: Enhanced public service quality and coverage

### 3. Geographic Analysis
- **County Breakdown**: Population, area, and density by county
- **Municipality Sizes**: Distribution of municipality sizes and characteristics
- **Density Patterns**: Population density analysis across the region

## Key Assumptions

### Population Data
- Based on 2020 US Census figures
- Target region includes Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic, and Union counties
- Consolidated population estimate: 3,610,711 people

### Economic Estimates
- Annual savings estimate: $500 million
- Government overhead reduction: 30%
- Infrastructure efficiency improvement: 40%
- Public services enhancement: 25%

### Ranking Methodology
- US city rankings based on population
- World city rankings include all major global cities
- Rankings calculated as of 2020 data

## Limitations

### Data Limitations
- Sample data used for demonstration (not real-time)
- Economic estimates are projections based on similar consolidation studies
- Geographic boundaries simplified for visualization

### Analytical Limitations
- Does not account for political feasibility
- Economic estimates are rough projections
- Social and cultural impacts not quantified

## Validation

### Cross-Reference Sources
- Population figures verified against US Census data
- City rankings cross-checked with multiple sources
- Economic estimates based on academic studies of municipal consolidation

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Multiple consolidation scenarios considered
- Range of economic impact estimates provided
- Conservative and optimistic projections included

## Future Enhancements

### Data Improvements
- Real-time data integration
- More detailed demographic breakdowns
- Historical trend analysis

### Analytical Enhancements
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Political feasibility assessment
- Social impact analysis
- Environmental impact considerations

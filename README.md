# New Jersey Consolidation Visualization Project

A comprehensive data visualization project exploring the potential for municipal consolidation in Northern New Jersey, inspired by the concept of creating a "Greater Jersey City" that would become the third largest city in the United States.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the fragmented municipal structure of Northern New Jersey and visualizes the potential benefits of consolidation, including:

- **Population Analysis**: Current vs. consolidated population scenarios
- **Geographic Visualization**: Interactive maps showing municipal boundaries
- **Economic Impact**: Cost savings and efficiency gains from consolidation
- **Comparative Analysis**: How a consolidated NJ would rank among world cities
- **Demographic Insights**: Population distribution and density analysis

## Key Findings

- Northern New Jersey (5 counties) has **3,610,711 people** across hundreds of municipalities
- If consolidated, it would be the **3rd largest city in the US** (after NYC and LA)
- Would rank **58th globally**, ahead of Madrid, Buenos Aires, and Toronto
- Current fragmentation leads to inefficient government spending and infrastructure

```

## Data Sources

- US Census Bureau (population, demographics)
- New Jersey Department of State (municipal boundaries)
- OpenStreetMap (geographic data)
- Various NJ government datasets

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the article ["New Jersey's Potential and a Plea for a Greater Jersey City"](https://papaghanoush.substack.com/p/new-jerseys-potential-and-a-plea) by Matty Monahan, which explores the concept of consolidating Northern New Jersey's municipalities into a single, more efficient city.
